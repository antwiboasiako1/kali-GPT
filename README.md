# 🐉 kali-GPT: Setting Up OpenAI in Kali Linux

This project documents the full setup process of running OpenAI tools (like GPT-based assistants) on **Kali Linux**. It includes steps such as updating the OS, creating Python scripts with Vim, installing OpenAI modules, and verifying the installation with a system reboot.

---

## 🔧 What This Project Covers

1. 🔄 System update after fresh Kali Linux install
2. ✍️ Using Vim to write a Python script
3. 📦 Installing the OpenAI Python package
4. ➕ Alternative method to install OpenAI via `pip`
5. 🔁 Rebooting and confirming functionality

All steps are shown with screenshots to help beginners follow along.
